### Task 2.1: RESTful API with CRUD Operations

>Before adding CRUD operations, I have created a multi-layered architecture with n layers. 
>The layers are Business, DataAccess, Entities, and WebAPI layers. 
>I abstracted the layers from each other and created ServiceRegistration extension methods for each layer to handle their own dependency injection registration processes.

### Task 2.2: Asynchronous Programming
>I have made all CRUD operations asynchronous.

- Asynchronous programming in web APIs boosts performance by handling multiple requests simultaneously and utilizing server resources efficiently.  
- This leads to faster response times and improved scalability, accommodating a growing user base seamlessly. 
- Consequently, users benefit from quicker interactions, enhancing their satisfaction and fostering loyalty to the platform.
